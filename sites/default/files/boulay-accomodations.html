The bedroom has a queen size bed and the living room in the home is airy and comfortable. Your bathroom has a shell design in the ceramic tile shower with green and verdant yard just outside the window.

We have tried to think of everything that you might possibly need or want in your island home. Cooking facilities are available for your use.  Listen to the stereo. Watch a movie on the VCR or just indulge in the cable television. The home is wonderfully ventilated, with a combination of ceiling fan and sliding glass doors, in the living room and onto the spacious backyard lanai. We don't want our guests to spend any of their Hawaiian vacation in a laundromat, so washer and dryer facilities are also available.Â
