  Boulay Inn is your own secluded home away from home.  There is a spacious airy living area, a queen sized bed, tiled shower and a verdant yard outside your windows.  Your accommodations are airy and comfortable with a combination of ceiling fans and sliding glass doors. We have tried to think of everything you might possibly need for your island home.  Cooking facilities, entertainment center, including cable TV and Wifi are all available.  No need to lug your hair dryer, there is one in your bath.  A washer and dryer are provided because we donâ€™t want you to spend any of your Hawaiian vacation in a laundromat.
