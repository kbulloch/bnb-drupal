Nestled in rural Omao on the south side of Kauai is the Boulay Inn.  It is your own secluded home away from home.  Tastefully decorated in island style decor, you will find more than ample room to enjoy your home on Kauai.  The entry is off Omao Road into the Boulay hale (home).  The bedroom has a queen size bed and the living room in the home is airy and comfortable. Your bathroom has a shell design in the ceramic tile shower with green and verdant yard just outside the window.

We have tried to think of everything that you might possibly need or want in your island home. Cooking facilities are available for your use.  Listen to the stereo. Watch a movie on the VCR or just indulge in the cable television. The home is wonderfully ventilated, with a combination of ceiling fan and sliding glass doors, in the living room and onto the spacious backyard lanai. We don't want our guests to spend any of their Hawaiian vacation in a laundromat, so washer and dryer facilities are also available.Â 

Omao is truly the hub of the wheel in terms of location for all east, west and south side activities, shopping and dining.  The Boulay Inn is just minutes away from Poipu Beach where you will find sunshine, diving, boogie boarding or snorkeling, and we will provide you with beach accessories at no extra charge.  If golf is your game, there are three beautiful courses within a 15 minute radius.

Is dining and shopping your passion?  Take a five minute drive to Old Koloa Town and beyond to Poipu with numerous local shopping venues.  The south side is noted for its excellent dining with restaurants representing all cultures.  No matter what type of food you are craving, you won't have to travel far in any direction to find your desire.

This is a smoke free property.
