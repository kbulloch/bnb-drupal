Watch a movie on the VCR or just indulge in the cable television. The home is wonderfully ventilated, with a combination of ceiling fan and sliding glass doors, in the living room and onto the spacious backyard lanai.

The Boulay Inn is just minutes away from Poipu Beach where you will find sunshine, diving, boogie boarding or snorkeling, and we will provide you with beach accessories at no extra charge.  If golf is your game, there are three beautiful courses within a 15 minute radius.
