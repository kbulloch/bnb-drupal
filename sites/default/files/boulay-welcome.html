Nestled in rural Omao on the south side of Kauai is the Boulay Inn.  It is your own secluded home away from home.  Tastefully decorated in island style decor, you will find more than ample room to enjoy your home on Kauai.  The entry is off Omao Road into the Boulay hale (home).

Omao is truly the hub of the wheel in terms of location for all east, west and south side activities, shopping and dining.  The Boulay Inn is just minutes away from Poipu Beach where you will find sunshine, diving, boogie boarding or snorkeling, and we will provide you with beach accessories at no extra charge.  If golf is your game, there are three beautiful courses within a 15 minute radius.

Is dining and shopping your passion?  Take a five minute drive to Old Koloa Town and beyond to Poipu with numerous local shopping venues.  The south side is noted for its excellent dining with restaurants representing all cultures.  No matter what type of food you are craving, you won't have to travel far in any direction to find your desire.

The Boulay Inn is a smoke free property.
